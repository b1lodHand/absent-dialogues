# Demos and Examples

In this section, you will see example use cases of this tool. Let's start!

>[!NOTE]
>I'll also be uploading videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ6e4ooQWudmDiPUO4RExtw) about this tool in the future.

## The Built-in Demo

It takes place at the **'Plugins/absencee_/absent-dialogues/Demo'** directory, under the **Assets** folder of your current unity project.

You can open up the **'./TMP/Demo_TMP.unity'** scene and press play to give it a try.

## More?

I'll be adding new demos and examples here as I develop games using this tool. You can jump to [Mechanism](https://b1lodhand.github.io/absent-dialogues/docs/getting-started/mechanism.html) and go on.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
Well, in order have this tool working properly you'll need to do a few things. For example: Unity... I'm just kidding. The instructions below will lead you on the way.

### Prerequisites

You can open the Package Manager via selecting Window/Package Manager options on the toolbar of Unity itself. Also, you can find the documentation of these tools in the same links above.

> [!WARNING]
> YOU NEED TextMeshPro package installed! You can also find the TextMeshPro via the Package Manager, under the Unity Registry panel.

### Installing
So, you've installed all the things necessary to run this tool. Now, it is the time of installing the tool itself.

This step is pretty much straightforward:

1. Go to: https://github.com/b1lodHand/absent-dialogues/releases

2. Find the the best release for you (I'd recommend the latest).

3. Download the ".unitypackage" file in that release by clicking it.

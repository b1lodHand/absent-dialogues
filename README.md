## About <a name = "about"></a>
Hello dear! You just stepped onto a completely free and open-source dialogue system for unity. With this tool, your dream game character dialogues can come true.  Well, I hear you saying "I love that, Tell me how to get it!". Scroll down, I'll be there to guide you.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
Well, in order have this tool working properly you'll need to do a few things. For example: Unity... I'm just kidding. The instructions below will lead you on the way.

### Prerequisites
First of all, this tool depends on some of my other tools. No, no, no, no! Don't run away! They are so lightweight and easy to setup.

```
https://github.com/b1lodHand/absent-variables.git
```
```
https://github.com/b1lodHand/absent-people.git
```
```
https://github.com/b1lodHand/absent-attributes.git
```
All you need to do is copying the URLs above and pasting them into you package manager.

You can open the Package Manager via selecting Window/Package Manager options on the toolbar of Unity itself. Also, you can find the documentation of these tools in the same links above.

YOU NEED TextMeshPro package installed! The legacy Unity UI without TMP is not supported by this tool at the moment. You can also import the TextMesPro via the Package Manager.

### Installing
So, you've installed all the things necessary to run this tool. Now, it is the time of installing the tool itself.

This step is pretty much straightforward:

1 - Go to: https://github.com/b1lodHand/absent-dialogues/releases

2 - Find the the best release for you (I'd recommend the latest).

3 - Download the ".unitypackage" file in that release by clicking it.

AND YOU HAVE IT! So now, how you use it? Let's see...

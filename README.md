## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
Well, in order have this tool working properly you'll need to do a few things. For example: Unity... I'm just kidding. The instructions below will lead you on the way.

### Prerequisites
First of all, this tool depends on some of my other tools. No, no, no, no! Don't run away! They are so lightweight and easy to setup.

You can open the Package Manager via the: **'Window/Package Manager'** menu on the toolbar of Unity itself. Also, you can find the documentation of these tools in the same links above.
